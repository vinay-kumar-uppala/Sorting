# Sorting
Sorting Algorithms
Bubble sort 
*Time Complexity
bestcase - O(n) when array sorted
worstcase - O(n2) when array is sorted in descending order
**Space O(1) -- there is no external use of array

Merge sort##
*Time Complexity
best case - O(nlogn)
Worst Case - O(nlogn) 
**Space O(n) as there is an external use of an array

Heap Sort
*Time Complexity
best case - Worst Case - O(nlogn)
**Space Complexity 
Is O(1) as there is no external use of array
